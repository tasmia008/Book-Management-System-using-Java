# BookManagementSystem

This code represents a basic GUI application for a Book Management System using Java Swing. Let's break down the key components:

Package Declaration: The code is part of the package bookmanagementsystem.

Imports: Various Java packages are imported to provide necessary classes and interfaces, including AWT, Swing, SQL, and others.

Class Declaration: The class BookManagementSystem extends JFrame and implements RESTfulAPI interface.

Instance Variables: Several instance variables are declared including text fields (JTextField), a combo box (JComboBox), and a button (JButton).

Constructor: The constructor initializes the GUI components, sets up the layout, and defines the behavior for the "Save" button.

Main Method: The main method starts the application by creating an instance of BookManagementSystem within the event dispatch thread using SwingUtilities.invokeLater().

Action Listener: An action listener is added to the "Save" button to handle the save operation. Inside this listener, data entered into the GUI components is retrieved and saved into a database using JDBC.

Database Operations: The code connects to a Derby database (jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/books) with a specific username and password, then executes an SQL INSERT query to save the book details into the books table.

Error Handling: SQLException is caught to handle errors during database operations. Error messages are displayed using JOptionPane.

Interface Implementation: The RESTfulAPI interface is implemented, but the methods (get(), post(), delete(), put()) are not implemented yet. Currently, they throw UnsupportedOperationException.
